# MNIST Digit Recognizer ✍️

A simple web application that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) drawn on a canvas. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, and it's deployed as an interactive web app using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces.

## How it Works
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the famous MNIST dataset. The `keras-tuner` library is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model architecture, ensuring better performance.

The user interface is built with **Gradio**, which provides an easy way to create a web demo for machine learning models.

## Files in this Repository
- **`app.py`**: The Gradio application script that loads the trained model and creates the web interface.
- **`cnn-model.py`**: The script to train the CNN model. It includes data preprocessing, model definition, hyperparameter tuning, and saving the best model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **`mnist.keras`**: The saved, trained Keras model file. *(Note: This file is generated by running `cnn-model.py` and needs to be uploaded to the Space)*.

## How to Run Locally
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/eginugraha/mnist
    cd mnist
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Train the model (if `mnist.keras` is not present)**:
    Run the training script to generate the `mnist.keras` model file.
    ```bash
    python cnn-model.py
    ```

4.  **Launch the Gradio app**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:7860` to use the application.
